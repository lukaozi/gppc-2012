This is the source code of the programs to use in the 2012 Pathfinding Competition.
The makefile is set to build two versions of the program:
-- cpd-comp-20m constructs a path in two stages: first add the 20 steps, and then the rest of the path.
-- cpd-comp-mbm constructs a path adding one move at a time (mbm stands for move by move).

The executables are located in dist/Release-20m/GNU-Linux-x86/ and dist/Release-mbm/GNU-Linux-x86 respectively.
Should there be a need to re-build them, run "rm -rf build dist" and then "make all" in the main directory.

The programs perform the preprocessing identically. It is sufficient to run the preprocessing only once.
To make sure that both programs can use the same preprocessed files (without having to rename and have duplicate copies of the files),
both programs return the same team name (CPD).

The only arguments in the command line are those coming from the competition API: -pre, -run, and -full.
